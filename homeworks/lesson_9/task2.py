# Task 2

# The sys module.

#  The “sys.path” list is initialized from the PYTHONPATH environment variable. 
#  Is it possible to change it from within Python? If so, does it affect where Python looks for module files? 
#  Run some interactive tests to find it out.

import sys


print(sys.path)

# del sys.path[0]

print(sys.path)
